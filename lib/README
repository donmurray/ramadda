Custom JAR files in the lib directory:

ramaddalib.jar:
  This holds all of the 3rd party libs  used by ramadda. It is made
  with the ant target: ramaddalib in src/org/ramadda/repository


ramaddatds.jar:
  This gets built from the THREDDS TDS war file.
  To build this:
  Get the latest thredds.war from the Unidata FTP site, e.g:
    ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds/4.2/current/thredds.war

  Now run the tcl script:
    tclsh ../src/org/ramadda/repository/bin/makethredds.tcl

  This unjars the war and unjars certain jars and makes repositorytds.jar


ncIdv.jar:
  This should be the definitive source of the netcdf package. It gets
  included in both the repositorytds.jar and the repositorylib.jar.
  We do this because other packages have netcdf in it (e.g., visad.jar)


visad.jar:
  Note: I unjarred this, removed the top-level nom package, and rebuilt
  the jar visad had an old version of the nom package (for fits data)
  and was screwing up the org/ramadda/geodata/fits plugin


jetty.jar:
This is the jetty-all-server.jar


tika-app-1.0.jar
  The tika-app-1.0.jar  has been modified. I (jeffmc) removed the
  ucar, thredds and com/drew  tree from this because we had too many
  conflicts with other libs


jmapproj.jar:

  This comes from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmapprojlib/ and
  is a Java implementation of the proj4 library.  It is used in the
  lidar package for doing coordinate transforms.


junit.jar:

  https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads This is from junit-4.10.jar
