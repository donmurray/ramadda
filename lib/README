repositorylib.jar:
This holds all of the 3rd party libs  used by ramadda. It is made with the ant target: repositorylib in 
src/org/ramadda/repository

repositorytds.jar:
This gets built from the THREDDS TDS war file.
To build this:
Get the latest thredds.war from the Unidata FTP site, e.g:
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar/pub/thredds/4.2/current/thredds.war

Now run the tcl script:
tclsh ../src/org/ramadda/repository/release/makethredds.tcl

This unjars the war and unjars certain jars and makes repositorytds.jar



ncIdv.jar:
This should be the definitive source of the netcdf package. It gets included in both the repositorytds.jar
and the repositorylib.jar. We do this because other packages have netcdf in it (e.g., visad.jar)

visad.jar:
Note: I unjarred this, removed the top-level nom package, and rebuilt the jar
visad had an old version of the nom package (for fits data) and was screwing up
the org/ramadda/geodata/fits plugin




tika-app-1.0.jar
The tika-app-1.0.jar  has been modified. I (jeffmc) removed the ucar, thredds and com/drew  tree from this because we had too many conflicts with other libs



jmapproj.jar:
This comes from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmapprojlib/ and is a Java implementation of the proj4 library.
It is used in the lidar package for doing coordinate transforms.
