repositorylib.jar:
This holds all of the 3rd party libs  used by ramadda. It is made with the ant target: repositorylib in 
src/org/ramadda/repository

repositorytds.jar:
This gets built from the THREDDS TDS war file.
To build this:
Get the latest thredds.war from the Unidata FTP site, e.g:
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar/pub/thredds/4.2/current/thredds.war

Now run the tcl script:
tclsh ../src/org/ramadda/repository/release/makethredds.tcl

This unjars the war and unjars certain jars and makes repositorytds.jar



ncIdv.jar:
This should be the definitive source of the netcdf package. It gets included in both the repositorytds.jar
and the repositorylib.jar. We do this because other packages have netcdf in it (e.g., visad.jar)

tika-app-0.9.jar
The tika-app-0.9.jar  has been modified. I (jeffmc) removed the ucar tree from this because we had too many conflicts
with ncIdv.jar
