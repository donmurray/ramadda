One of the Unidata Program Center's core strengths has centered around data management - 
developing and supporting  technologies to store and access data on disk (e.g., NetCDF, CDM), 
transfer streams  of data (LDM) and serve that data remotely (e.g., TDS, ADDE). 
The <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/Projects/THREDDS/tech/TDS.html">THREDDS Data Server (TDS)</a>
has been one of the key components of this suite. In order to augment
the TDS  Unidata has been  exploring the development of services  to provide richer mechanisms for managing data collections
and enabling end users to create and share data. The initial prototype effort 
was the THREDDS Data Repository (TDR)  - a web based application that supported the upload and
cataloging of data from end users and client applications. In the past year another effort,
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ramadda/">RAMADDA</a>, has begun to provide
a much wider range of data management services than initially envisioned for the TDR. 
<p>
RAMADDA  is a &quot;content management system&quot; for geoscience data. 
A major impetus for this work is the rapid evolution of  the Web as an information publishing  and access medium.
Much of the design and development of RAMADDA is inspired by the numerous examples of web-based systems that support information creation, 
management and sharing. These <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> systems,
such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wikis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogs</a>,
have had a fundamental impact on how people create, share, find and access information.
<p>
The evolution of RAMADDA has brought us to the realization that it may be the technology framework that integrates
much of Unidata's data management technology suite. This paper is intended to give an overview of the major 
functional and design aspects of  the TDS, TDR and RAMADDA and to suggest some possible  paths for their future integration.


<h2>TDS</h2>
The TDS is composed of a set of services that provide access to remote data and  is centered around 
the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/tech/catalog/InvCatalogSpec.html">THREDDS catalog</a>.
Catalogs provide a simple hierarchical structure for organizing a collection of datasets, a means of 
accessing each dataset, a human understandable name for each dataset, and a structure on which further 
descriptive information can be placed. The catalog provides both the underlying information 
model on which the TDS is built as well as the primary way of presenting that information to users and clients.
<p> 
The major features of the TDS include:

<ul>
<li> Dynamically scan file systems and generate THREDDS Catalogs listing the available data sets and the 
set of available services. The scanning is configured by a server administrator editing catalog templates that 
contain directives to control the scanning and have hard-coded metadata information. 

<li> Generate an HTML representation of these catalogs.

<li> An OpenDAP service for remote access to the data.

<li> A grid subset service that allows users to subset a grid based on time, space and parameters. 
This creates a new NetCDF file and returns it to the user.

<li> Grid aggregation. Provide the ability to aggregate a set of data files as a synthetic data set - e.g., creating a dataset 
that is the Nth hour forecast from a set of files.

<li> Web Coverage Service (WCS)  for gridded files.

<li> Miscellaneous collection services - the radar collection service has embedded logic of where radar files are stored and 
will extract information  by looking at directory and file names of the radar files. This can answer questions 
like "what times are available for a particular  station"
</ul>



<h2>TDR</h2>


The THREDDS Data Repository (TDR) was a first attempt at providing the ability to upload data to a TDS. 
This exploratory effort
demonstrated  the usefulness of such a service and helped Unidata staff gain an understanding of the fundamental requirements
within this (for us) new domain area.
The effort also made clear the need to go beyond file 
system and catalog XML file based storage mechanisms for content management. The TDR provided a mechanism for
end users or client applications to create new datasets through an HTTP upload interface. 
The metadata information required to define
these entities was stored within separate catalog XML files on disk. Every time new content was added, changed or deleted
the system had to open an XML file, make the appropriate change and then write out the XML file to disk.
<p>
This approach enabled a loose coupling with the TDS in that the TDS could just read those XML catalog files when providing
its services.  However, at heart the TDR was a content management system and needed to provide basic 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)</a> services. 
It became clear as development of the TDR progressed  that this file based approach  was awkward and did not scale
to large repositories.  This led Unidata staff to begin investigating a relational database approach.


<h2>RAMADDA</h2>
The approach  taken in the development of RAMADDA is to view this problem space as one of content management.
RAMADDA is a content management framework that 
can be configured to manage different types of data and information and  provides 
different ways of viewing and accessing this content. 
Some of the underlying  design philosophies include:

<ul>
<li> Focus on 3 major functions - content creation, organization and access.
<li> Underlying relational database as storage mechanism.  This provides sophisticated 
information  management capabilities  and enables search and query mechanisms.  
<li> Separate content from presentation. The core underlying model used within RAMADDA is quite similar
to that which can be expressed within THREDDS catalogs. However, it has been recognized that ends users and 
client applications require a wide range of mechanisms to view and access this content.
<li> Agnosticism. The core part of RAMADDA makes very few assumptions about the types of content it handles and
how that content is accessed. There is however an understanding that the content can be geo-spatial and temporal 
in nature.
<li> Extensibility. RAMADDA is a framework and supports the inclusion  of new types of data, metadata and views 
of the information.
<li> A range of use contexts -  case studies, user created content (e.g., "youtube of data"), 
field project catalogs, large real-time archives (e.g., the IDD).
</ul>




<h3>Content Creation</h3>
RAMADDA supports a variety of ways of creating content:
<ul> 
 <li> HTML file upload. The end user can upload data files (or other information) through a web browser.
 <li> Web service for client upload. An XML based description of data coupled with the actual data files can be uploaded.
      This is used by the IDV to publish generated products directly into RAMADDA.
 <li> File system harvester. Monitors areas of the server file system and automatically ingests new data files into the database.
 <li> URL based harvester. Download URL based resources (e.g., web cam images) on a scheduled basis.
 <li> THREDDS catalog harvester. Scan remote catalogs and add their information to the database.
 <li> An LDM notification mechanism. This connects an LDM feed into RAMADDA and triggers the application of the file harvesters.
 <li> File system interface. RAMADDA can be configured to provide services for data files on a file system. 
 One can specify top-level server file paths and RAMADDA will provide dynamic access to the files in those trees. This is provided to both 
 make it extremely easy for  RAMADDA  to be configured and can also provide RAMADDA services to very large data 
 collections (e.g., the 100 million file LEAD archive) without the performance hit of scanning and ingesting into the database 
 the full collection.
</ul>


<h3>Content Organization</h3>

The core of RAMADDA is an extensible data model centered around entries, groups and associated metadata. 
RAMADDA takes an agnostic approach as to what these components represent. An entry may be a file on disk 
(e.g., a model file), a url or some other bit of information (e.g., a blog post). A group is simply an 
entry that can hold a number of children entries. Groups provide 
a hierarchical organization. An entry has a single parent group. A group may have any number of children 
entries and groups. The hierarchy allows for overall organization of the information (e.g., models, 
radar, case studies, etc) and facilitates browse based navigation.

<p>
Entries have some common descriptive information - name, description, time range, lat/lon bounding box, 
creator, etc. There is also an extensible metadata model that allows for a variety of metadata to be 
attached to an entry. For example, RAMADDA supports the set of 
THREDDS metadata - keyword, property, contributor, project, etc.


<h3>Content Viewing and Access</h3>
RAMADDA is based on a Model/View/Control framework. Instances of the model are created by the central Repository. 
The information typically comes from the  underlying database but it can also come from dynamically scanning the 
file system or by processing external Catalogs on the fly. 
The model instance is then passed to any number of Output Handlers (the Views). These include a variety of 
HTML views, a THREDDS Catalog view, an RSS feed, zip file, OpenDAP and grid subset handlers.
We are also exploring the integration of  IDV based product generation within RAMADDA. 



<h2>TDS and RAMADDA Integration</h2>
As the development and use of RAMADDA has evolved it has begun to incorporate some of the key
TDS data services - OpenDAP and grid subsetting. We plan to continue this  process.
The integration of these services was relatively straight
forward. The TDS server as an active server is not used. Rather, the underlying TDS code base was used.
RAMADDA simply provided bridge code between its information space and the TDS space and routed these
service requests through to the TDS code. RAMADDA simply  re-contextualized the TDS code.
<p>
This evolution  of RAMADDA and its adoption of the TDS services brings up the question of whether Unidata should 
fully integrate these systems (e.g., Next Generation TDS).  The TDS brings a long history of providing robust
and sophisticated access to data. RAMADDA provides a suite of complementary data ingest, management, and access services
as well as an integrated web application framework. Furthermore,  the development of the next generation LDM could provide
the ability to integrate LDM data streams directly into RAMADDA.
<p>
While the full range of issues that would arise from this overall technology integration 
needs to be determined the use of RAMADDA as the framework for future TDS development holds great promise.
We believe that RAMADDA holds the potential to be the long discussed &quot;Unidata in a box&quot;, i.e., a 
turn-key system that supports the full spectrum of data ingest,  management, access and product generation services.
