<faqitem cxat="Logins and User Account" q="I forgot my user id. How do I retrieve it?" >
If your RAMADDA site has been configured to send email (see <a href="#email">here</a> to configure email)
then on the Login page you should see &quot;Forget your User ID?&quot; and
&quot;Forget your Password?&quot; links. 
</faqitem>


<faqitem id="checkbox" q="How do I select multiple checkboxes at once?">
In RAMADDA when there is a collection of checkboxes in a form (e.g., in the entry list or in the edit metadata form)
selecting one and then
selecting another with a Shift-Click toggles the range of checkboxes between the first the second
checkbox clicked. Doing a Control-Click on a checkbox toggles all of them on or off.
</faqitem>





<faqitem cat="Administration" id="ssl" q="How do I configure SSL access to RAMADDA?" >
To configure SSL access see <a href="installing.html#ssl">here</a> if you are running under Tomcat.
See <a href="installing.html#ssljetty">here</a> if you are running stand-alone.
</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="allowedlogin" q="I want to restrict where users can login from" >
For security reasons you can configure what IP addresses users are allowed to login from.
In your <i>repository.properties</i> file in your local RAMADDA directory, e.g.,<pre>
&lt;home&gt;/.unidata/repository/repository.properties</pre>
add the property:<pre>

##Comma separated list of ip addresses (or prefixes) that are the ones where the user can login
##If blank then login is allowed from anywhere
ramadda.login.allowedips=
##e.g.:
##ramadda.login.allowedips=127.0.0,201.43.72.5
</pre>
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="fixssl" q="Oops, I told RAMADDA to use an SSL port and SSL is not working. Now I cannot access the admin page to turn off SSL and I'm stuck. What can I do?" >
You need to comment out the ramadda.ssl.port property in your .properties file.
Alternatively, you can run RAMADDA with the command line argument:
<pre>-Dramadda.ssl.ignore=true</pre>
</faqitem>

<faqitem cat="Administration" q="I forgot the administrator password and cannot access RAMADDA. How do I login?" >
You can specify an administrator user id and password from the command line when starting RAMADDA.
If you are running RAMADDA stand alone then just provide the arguments:<pre>
-admin &lt;user id&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</pre>
This creates a new user id if needed and sets the password.
<p>
If you are running RAMADDA under Tomcat then change the web.xml to pass in command line arguments
using the &quot;args&quot; entry. This is a comma separated value list of the command line arguments
that are processed by RAMADDA.
<pre>
    &lt;param-name&gt;args&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;-admin,userid,password&lt;/param-value&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can also set a username/password  in the repository.properties file in the RAMADDA home directory. Just add:<pre>
ramadda.admin=userid:password
</pre>
and then restart RAMADDA. This sets the password for the given userid.
Note: you should remove this entry once you have reset your password.
</faqitem>



<faqitem cat="Administration" id="email" q="How do I configure RAMADDA to send email?" >
RAMADDA can send email for both the password reset process and for monitoring new entries.
On the main Site Administration  page under the &quot;Contact&quot; area you can specify
a SMTP server that RAMADDA will use to send email.
</faqitem>


<faqitem cat="Administration" id="template" q="I want to change the html design of RAMADDA" >
The HTML pages that RAMADDA generates are based on a template mechanism.
Here is an example template: <a href="template.html.txt">template.html.txt</a>.
Copy the example to your local RAMADDA directory (strip off the .txt):<pre>
&lt;user home&gt;/.unidata/repository/resources/template.html
</pre>
This is one of the places where RAMADDA looks for templates.
<p>
In the template are a set of properties. You should change the id and name property.
There are a number of other  macros shown as <i>${macro}</i> that are used to 
instantiate a web page.  The ${content} is where the generated html is placed.
<p>
The ${root} is the root directory path used by RAMADDA, e.g., &quot;repository&quot;. You can reference 
files (e.g., style sheets, images) with this path, e.g.:<pre>
    &lt;img src="${root}/someimage.png"&gt;
</pre>
When RAMADDA is serving a file (e.g., someimage.png) it will look in:
    &lt;user home&gt;/htdocs</pre>
So place any files you want served in that directory.
<p>


RAMADDA uses the &quot;ramadda.html.templates&quot; property, a semi-colon delimited list of
file paths,  to find where the templates are.
The default value for this property is:
<pre>
    ramadda.html.templates=%repositorydir%/resources/template.html;%resourcedir%/templates/wikipedia.html;...
</pre>

If you wanted to change this then make some <i>.properties</i> file with the new paths, e.g.,:<pre>
    ramadda.html.templates=%repositorydir%/resources/template1.html;%repositorydir%/resources/template2.html;...
</pre>
and place the .properties file in the plugins directory:<pre>
    &lt;user home&gt;/plugins
</pre>

Normally, RAMADDA will cache template in memory so if you are modifying the template
you can't just hit reload in your browser. You would need to restart RAMADDA.
To get around this you can run set the property:<pre>
    ramadda.cacheresources=false
</pre> in your properties file or specify this property on the command line:
<pre>
    java -Xmx1024m -server   ucar.unidata.repository.RepositoryServer -Dramadda.cacheresources=false
</pre>

Don't forget to unset this property when in production.
