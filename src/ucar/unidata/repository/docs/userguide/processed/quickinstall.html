<div class="pagetitle">11.1 Quick Installation</div>



If you are like most people you don't want to have to deal with lengthy install and configuration processes.
This document will show you how to have a RAMADDA server running on your machine serving  up your data
sets in about 5 minutes or less.
<p>
Note: If you have the inclination and/or already have a Tomcat server running
consult the full length <a href="installing.html">installation documentation</a>.





<h2>Downloading and Installing RAMADDA</h2>
<ul>

<li> Requirements: You need to have Java 1.6 (or higher) installed on your machine. Also, by default RAMADDA runs on port 8080 so this port should be open through your firewall.

<li> To download RAMADDA from the Unidata site you need to be registered. If you are not already you can <a target="_register" href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/account/account.jsp">register here</a>.


<li> Download the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/ramadda/1_1/ftp/repository.zip">repository.zip</a> file and unzip the file  to where you want to install RAMADDA.

<li> Change directory to the ramadda install directory and (assuming you have java in your path) run <i>ramadda.sh</i>.
If you are on a a Windows machine there is a ramadda.bat as well.
<br>
To run RAMADDA run the ramadda.sh in the release directory. This just does:<pre>
   java -Xmx512m -jar repository.jar
</pre>


By default the server is on port 8080.  To change the port  edit ramadda.sh and change the line to:<pre>
    java -Xmx512m -jar repository.jar -port &lt;some port&gt;
</pre>


<li> Now, in your web browser go to: http://yourserver:8080/repository

<li> Go through the initial configuration pages, create an administrator account and log in.


</ul>

<h2>Accessing your data</h2>

You can create and organize content in RAMADDA in a number of ways but we'll show you how to provide access 
to data that is already on your server, e.g., from a Unidata LDM/IDD data feed.

<ul>


<li> Now, lets assume you have a data directory on your server, e.g., <i>/data/ldm</i>

<li> First, we need to tell RAMADDA that it is OK to provide access to that area of your file system. 




<li> Go to the site Administration pages from the &quot;Admin&quot; link:

<div class="cimg"><a href="images/quick/adminlink.gif"><img  src="images/quick/adminlink.gif" border=0 alt="images/quick/adminlink.gif" ></a></div>

<li> Open the  &quot;Access &quot; section and enter the data directory, e.g., /data/ldm, in the &quot;File system access&quot; field and press Change Settings:

<div class="cimg"><a href="images/quick/access.gif"><img  src="images/quick/access.gif" border=0 alt="images/quick/access.gif" ></a></div>


<li> Now you need to create an entry that provides access to that data.

<ul>
<li> Go to the top-level entry in RAMADDA (the &quot;Top&quot; link in the upper left).

<li> Select &quot;New Entry&quot; under the File menu.

<li> In the &quot;Or create a&quot; list choose Local File View and press Go:
<div class="cimg"><a href="images/quick/createentry.gif"><img  src="images/quick/createentry.gif" border=0 alt="images/quick/createentry.gif" ></a></div>


<li>  This will take you to the Local File View Entry create form. Enter a name, the file path and that
patterns  that match the files you want to exclude. When done press &quot;Add Local File View&quot;
<div class="cimg"><a href="images/quick/localfileview.gif"><img  src="images/quick/localfileview.gif" border=0 alt="images/quick/localfileview.gif" ></a></div>

Note: If you are providing access to your LDM/IDD data feed and you are also getting the NLDN lightning data and/or the ACARS feed make sure
you exclude those directories and files.


<li> Congratulations you are done! To access your server from Unidata's Integrated Data View (IDV) go to the top level entry, click on the 
View menu and copy the &quot;Catalog&quot; link into the IDV's catalog data chooser.


</ul>
