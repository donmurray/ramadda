<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<div class="boxquote">
Note: Many users ask if upgrading RAMADDA will effect any existing content. All of the content and files are kept in the RAMADDA home directory and in the database. As long as those directories remain untouched there should not be any problem in upgrading. However, you will need to update any plugins you have installed in the RAMADDA plugins directory. 
</div>


To update an existing RAMADDA install:

<ul>

<li> Update plugins
<ul>
<li> If you have installed the old allplugins.<i>zip</i> then delete the file and install  the new 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/1.7/allplugins.jar/download">allplugins.jar</a>.
Plugins are installed in the <i>&lt;ramadda home&gt;/plugins</i> directory. 
If you currently have allplugins.jar installed  then RAMADDA will update it automatically.

<li> If you have the pointplugin.jar installed then delete it. It is now provided in the core.

<li> If you have other plugins installed then you should update them to the latest <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda1.7/plugins/">versions</a>.

</ul>

<li> Install the new server

<ul>


<li> If you are running stand-alone then download and unzip the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda1.7/ramadda1.7.zip/download">ramadda1.7.zip</a>. You will need to adjust your scripts to point to the ramadda1.7 directory.

<li> If you are running under Tomcat or Glassfish download and install the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda1.7/repository.war">repository.war</a>

</ul>
</ul>


<h2>What's new in version 1.6?</h2>
<ul> 

<li> This release features a new <a href="http://ramadda.org/repository/alias/displays">display front-end </a> integrated into the wiki facility. This enables the creation of rich interactive search, charting and data access interfaces across multiple federated  repositories.

<li> New  entry types - <a href="http://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show/Home/RAMADDA+Examples/Miscellany/Virtual+Groups?entryid=f5ccdc47-62f7-481a-b67d-bf76e5b34359">Virtual Group</a>,  <a href="http://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show/Home/RAMADDA+Information/Development/Example+Case+Study?entryid=b6ce8986-0a93-4436-8ec4-d30eb092365e">Case Study</a>, <a href="http://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show/Home/RAMADDA+Examples/Science+Data/Ontologies/CF+Standard+Names?entryid=66e17bbf-cdef-40b6-a875-e035c98072c3">Vocabulary</a>, etc.

<li> <a href="editing.html#extended">Extended entry editing</a> including the ability to change entry types.

<li> The beginnings of an entry type, metadata and data dictionary <a href="http://ramadda.org/repository/metameta/index.html">editor</a>.

<li> Automatic <a href="http://ramadda.org/repository/entry/show/Home/RAMADDA+Examples/Miscellany/Documents?entryid=babccf50-d206-4546-9fd6-b6c9ff67291a">extraction of thumbnail images</a> from powerpoint and word files.

<li> And as usual, lots  of bug fixes and additions to the documentation.
<div class="boxquote">
Note: The  1.6 release fixes a long-standing but recently discovered issue that results in having user passwords occasionally appear in the server side access logs.   See <a href="#passwords">below</a> for more details.
</div>




</ul>

The 1.6 release  is SVN revision r4079



<a name="passwords"></a>
<h2>Password Exposure</h2>

Up until and including  RAMADDA V1.6B there is the possibility to have clear text passwords written out in the server side access logs. The 1.6 release fixes this problem.

We strongly recommend users take the following steps:
<ul>
<li> Delete any of the access.log or repository.log files in your <i>&lt;ramadda home&gt;/logs</i> directory on your server.   If you are running RAMADDA from within Apache and/or Tomcat they too may have the passwords exposed in their access logs. 
<li> Upgrade to the latest 1.6 release and change your  RAMADDA passwords. 
There is a new Admin-&gt;Maintenance-&gt;Clear All Passwords service that allows you to
clear all of the passwords held in the RAMADDA user database.
<li> Some RAMADDA html templates may import resources (e.g., style sheets, images) from servers other than RAMADDA.  In that case, passwords may also  be exposed in those server logs in the REFERER HTTP argument.
</ul>







<b>What happened?</b><br>
When you are visiting any page in RAMADDA the Login link that is shown has an extra <i>redirect</i> argument which is the URL of the  page you are viewing. Normally, if you are viewing a page and then go to login, after a successful login you will be redirected back to the original page.
<p>

The exposure comes about in the following way:
<ul>
<li> Go to the login page and enter an incorrect  password or userid and attempt to login
<li> The result page will show the login error. But, the  Login link in the upper right will have as its redirect argument the original credentials. If you then login correctly through the form there is no problem.
<li> However,  if you click on the Login link again then login successfully you will be redirected back to the login page with your original credentials showing up in the URL. This results in your password being passed back to the server as the REFERER URL for that page and any resources the page loads. 
</ul>


My apologies for this problem. I strive to make RAMADDA secure but this slipped through the cracks.  If you have any questions please <a href="mailto:jeff.mcwhirter@gmail.com">contact me</a>.
