RAMADDA version 1.6 is now available for download at:

Note: This release fixes a long-standing but recently discovered issue that results in having user passwords occasionally appear in the server side access logs.  

We strongly recommend users take the following steps:
<ul>
<li> Upgrade to the latest 1.6 release.
<li> Delete any of the access.log or repository.log files in your ramadda home/logs directory on your server.
<li> If you are running RAMADDA from within Apache and/or Tomcat they too may have the passwords exposed in their access logs. 
<li> Change your  RAMADDA passwords. 
<li> See <a href="#passwords">below</a> for more details.
</ul>

My apologies for this problem. I strive to make RAMADDA secure but this slipped through the cracks.  If you have any questions please <a href="mailto:jeff.mcwhirter@gmail.com">contact me</a>.

This release features a new display front-end - <a href="http://ramadda.org/repository/alias/displays">http://ramadda.org/repository/alias/displays</a>.

<div class="boxquote">
You may need to update your plugins. Plugins are installed in the <i>&lt;ramadda home&gt;/plugins</i> directory. Most of the plugins are provided in an 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda1.6/allplugins.jar/download">allplugins.jar</a> file. If you are installing RAMADDA for the first time you can opt to install the allplugins.jar during
the site installation process.
<p>

To update an existing RAMADDA install:
<ul>

<li> If you are running stand-alone then you will need to adjust your scripts to point to the ramadda1.6 directory.

<li> If you have installed the old allplugins.<i>zip</i> then delete the file and install allplugins.<i>jar</i>. 
Once you have installed allplugins.jar then RAMADDA will update it automatically in future releases.

<p>
<li> If you have the pointplugin.jar installed then delete it. It is now provided in the core.
<p>
<li> If you have other plugins installed then you should update them to the latest <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda1.6/plugins/">versions</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Password Exposure</h2>

Some RAMADDA html templates may import resources (e.g., style sheets, images) from somewhere other than RAMADDA.  In that case, passwords may also  be exposed in the REFERER HTTP argument for the resource request.
To check grep for "password=" in the logs. Delete the logs if necessary. 

There is a new Admin-&gt;>Maintenance-&gt;Clear All Passwords service that allows you to
clear all of the passwords held in the RAMADDA user database.


When you are visiting any page in RAMADDA the Login link that is shown has an extra <i>redirect</i> argument which is the URL of the  page you are viewing. Normally, if you are viewing a page and then go to login, after a successful login you will be redirected back to the original page.


The exposure comes about in the following way:
<ul>
<li> Go to the login page
<li> Enter an incorrect  password or userid and attempt to login
<li> The result page will show the login error. But, the  Login link in the upper right will have as its redirect argument the original credentials.
<li> In the result page,  if you then login correctly through the form there is no problem.
<li> However,  if you click on the Login link again then login successfully you will be redirected back to the login page with your original credentials showing up in the URL. 
</ul>
