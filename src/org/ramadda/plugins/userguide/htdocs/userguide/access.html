You can define access control settings under the &quot;Edit -&gt; Access&quot; menu for an entry.


<a name="image1"></a><div class="cimg"><a href="images/access.png"><img  src="images/access.png" border=0 width=600 alt="Entry Access Control" ></a><br><span class="caption">Image 1: Entry Access Control</span></div>

The access control mechanism in RAMADDA is centered around a set of access types (e.g., viewing, new, edit)
and a set of roles and/or users that have permissions to do those tasks.
On the left of this form lists each of the access types. Under each access type
is a field where you can enter a user role (one per line).
<p>
On the right shows a summary table for the paricular entry we are viewing. This shows the access control
settings for all of the ancestor folders of the entry and allows the user to see just what access settings
are applicable to the entry.


<a name="accesstypes"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">7.0 Access Types</div> 

The different access types are:
<ul>
<a name="view"></a>
<li> View - Can a user view the entry. If a user does not have view access they will simply not
see the entry and cannot access any aspect of the entry.

<a name="viewchildren"></a>
<li> View Children - This is used for a folder where a user without permission can see that the folder exists (e.g., "Unidata Only")
but cannot see any of the details of the folder or any of the children entry of the folder.

<a name="file"></a>
<li> File - This allows users to see the information about an entry but they cannot access the file. i.e., they cannot download the
file or access any of the content of the file (e.g., through OpenDAP).

<a name="edit"></a>
<li> Edit - Can a user edit the entry.

<a name="new"></a>
<li> New - Can a user create a new sub-folder or sub-entry. Note: when users have this permission they
also need Edit permission.

<a name="upload"></a>
<li> Upload - This provides anonymous upload capability. For example, we use this
to provide an <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/entry/show/Top/IDV+Community+Resources/Contributions?entryid=bfc82cf9-8548-4393-af10-20ec2274ceb9">area </a> for IDV users to upload shared content.
When a file is uploaded it is marked so that only administrators or owners of the Folder can access it. The owner
of the folder will receive an email (if email is configured) notifying them of the uploaded file.
In the Edit page for the uploaded Entry the owner can "bless" the entry to make it available to others.
<p>
If you want more people than the owner to receive notification simply add  a "Contact" property to the folder
that contains the other recipient's email.

<a name="delete"></a>
<li> Delete - Can  a user delete an entry.

<a name="comment"></a>
<li> Comment - Can a user comment on an entry.

</ul>

<a name="roles"></a><div class="pagesubtitle">7.1 Roles</div> 

Each access type form entry can contain any number of roles (one per line). 
<ul>
<li> User roles - All users can have one or more roles. This is set by the site administrator 
when editing the user. They are just string names.
<li> Self identity role - If you enter a role in the form as <i>user:someuserid</i> this grants 
access to that specific user.
<li> <i>any</i> - this is a special role and says that anyone can do the action.
<li> <i>none</i> - nobody (except admins) can do the action.
<li> <i>ip:ip address</i>  - This format grants access to incoming requests with the given ip address or ip address suffix.
For example, <i>ip:128.117</i> would grant access to any request coming from UCAR's network.

<li> <i>!some role</i> - Prefixing a role with &quot;!&quot; is a way to deny specific access to a user, role, or ip address.
For example, <i>!ip:128.117</i> would deny access to any request coming from UCAR's network.
</ul>
