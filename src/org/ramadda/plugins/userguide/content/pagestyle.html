[ht::head {Page Styles}]

<%nochildlist%>

You can control much of how the  html pages are shown using a Page Style property.
Go to the [ht::menu Edit {Add Property}] menu and
under "Attachments, Contact, Etc" select Page Style.
The Page Style property allows you to specify what menus to show, whether to show other features and
you can also specify a WIKI text template to use for the default HTML views of the entries:

[ht::cimg images/pagestyle.png {Page Style Create Form} {border=1}]

To control if the menu bar is shown and what menus get show enter either "none" in
the menus field (to not show the menu bar) or a comma separated list of the
menus you do want to show. <b>Note: Just so you don't lost the ability to
edit the entry the menu bar is always shown for users who have edit privileges for the
entry being displayed.
</b>
<p>


You can have a Page Style apply to a whole sub-tree of RAMADDA entries. Add the Page Style
property to the Folder entry and check on Inherit.
<p>
You can have any number of Page Style properties and have them apply to certain entry types
by specifying the Entry Type. For example, you can have one page style that is applicable
to File entries and one that is applicable to Folders.
