If you are running RAMADDA with the Derby database then RAMADDA has the ability to 
create self-contained sub-repositories that are wholly independent from the parent repository.
Derby is required because the database is stored fully in the RAMADDA home directory and RAMADDA has 
control over creating multiple databases.




<ul>
<li> Go to Admin->Local Repositories
<li> Specify a repository ID, e.g. "test"
<li> Specify an admin ID and password.
<li> Once created, the new repository can be accessed at:
<pre>
http://hostname/&lt;base&gt;/repos/&lt;sub repository&gt;
e.g:
http://community.ramadda.org/repository/repos/data
</pre>

<li> You can login to a sub repository with the credentials from its parent repository
<li> Sub- repositories themselves can contain sub-repositories
</ul>


<h2>Moving a sub-repository</h2>

<ul>

<li> In your RAMADDA home directory there should be a directory:
<pre>
repositories/repository_test
</pre>
This is the home directory of the test repository.


<li> Move the repository_test directory to the server or location
Edit the repository.properties - comment out ramadda.html.urlbase and ramadda_home

Add an admin to the properties file -  http://ramadda.org/repository/userguide/faq.html#faq1_cat1_6

ramadda.admin=userid:password


If you have https configured for tomcat specify the port in the properties file:
http://ramadda.org/repository/userguide/installing.html#ssl

Specify  the ramadda_home property in a separate repository.properties in the Tomcat conf directory - http://ramadda.org/repository/userguide/installing.html#tomcat -  to point to the repository_above dir

Once you're running you should be able to go to http://<server>/repository
Log in as admin and go to Admin->Settings page and clear the hostname and port - you don't have to set a new one

</ul>
