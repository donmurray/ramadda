First you need to download RAMADDA.
The RAMADDA downloads area can be accessed at the SourceForge site:<br>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files">https://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files</a>.
<p>

RAMADDA can run under <a href="#tomcat">Tomcat</a> or can 
run <a href="#standalone">stand alone</a>.


<subhead intoc="false" id="tomcat">Running under Tomcat</subhead>
We'll assume you have Tomcat or some other servlet container already installed.

<ol>
<li> First,  download the repository.war file at the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/">RAMADDA SourceForge</a> site. 

<li> Before installing the repository.war you should consult
how to define the RAMADDA <a href="#home">home directory</a>.

<li> To run under Tomcat just 
place the repository.war in the tomcat webapps directory. 

<li> Go to the /repository page in your browser to continue the installation process, e.g.:
<a href="http://localhost:8080/repository">http://localhost:8080/repository</a>.

<li> 
By default the repository is accessed at /repository on the web server. 
With Tomcat the top-level path can only be a single level and
corresponds to the name of the war file. 
If you change the top-level path for Tomcat then you also need to tell 
RAMADDA what this path is. You do that in a properties file (see below) with:
<pre>
ramadda.html.urlbase=/repository
</pre>

<li> Depending on what plugins are loaded you may need to change the Java configuration in your Tomcat 
start up. (especially the IDV plugin)
Add this argument to your Java properties:<pre>
java ... -XX:MaxPermSize=256m ...
</pre>


</ol>

<subhead intoc="false" id="standalone">Running Standalone</subhead>

You can run RAMADDA stand-alone. This only requires  Java 1.6 or greater. 
<ol>
<li> Download  the ramadda&lt;version&gt;.zip file 
at the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/">RAMADDA SourceForge</a> site. 
<li> Unzip the file and consult the README.

<li> Or, just skip reading the documentation (like everyone else does)
and jump right in and start RAMADDA. 
In the release directory there are both ramadda.sh and ramadda.bat scripts. Just run them, e.g.:
<pre>
   sh ramadda.sh
</pre>

<li> The rest of the RAMADDA configuration is done through the web at
<a href="http://localhost:8080/repository">http://localhost:8080/repository</a>.

<li> By default the server is on port 8080.  To change the port do:<pre>
    sh ramadda.sh -port &lt;some port&gt;
</pre>

</ol>

<subhead intoc="false" id="home">RAMADDA Home Directory</subhead>

RAMADDA uses a local home directory on the server.
This is where RAMADDA looks for properties files and other resources, where the 
java derby database is stored and where any uploaded data files are stored, etc. 
<p>
By default ramadda will use: <pre>
   &lt;server process home directory&gt;/.ramadda</pre>
i.e., the home directory of the process that is running the server (.e.g., "tomcat").
<p>
You can override this a number of ways - some good some not so good. 
What ramadda does is look for the property: <i>ramadda_home</i> in a variety of places, in precedence:

<ol>

<li> When running stand-alone just pass the home directory as a command line argument:
<pre>
    sh ramadda.sh -Dramadda_home=&lt;home dir&gt;
</pre>


<li> For Tomcat you can edit the web.xml from the repository.war. Specify the command line property:<pre>
    &lt;param-value&gt;-Dramadda_home=/home/dir&lt;/param-value&gt;
</pre>

The problem with this is you have to unjar the war and change the web.xml. Then, when you install a 
new release of RAMADDA you have to always remember to edit the web.xml file again. Uggh.

<li> As a Java environment variable<br>
Wherever you define the arguments that are passed to <i>java</i> when starting Tomcat include:<pre>
   -Dramadda_home=/home/dir
</pre>
e.g.:<pre>
    java -Xmx512m  -Dramadda_home=/home/dir
</pre>

<li> As a process environment variable.<br>
Environment variables can be set for the tomcat process
Just define:<pre>
    ramadda_home=/home/dir</pre>



<li> The best way for Tomcat.
RAMADDA looks for a repository.properties file under the Tomcat &quot;conf&quot; directory.
It looks for any of the environment variables:
<pre>
CATALINA_BASE
catalina.base
CATALINA_HOME
catalina.home
</pre>
and  looks for a file under them, e.g.:
<pre>
${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/repository.properties
</pre>

if found then RAMADDA looks for the property:
<pre>
ramadda_home=/path/to/ramadda/home
</pre>

This is probably the cleanest way to do the initial confifuration of RAMADDA. Assuming you have set the CATALINA_BASE environment variable this does not require editing any files and you don't 
need to do anything when you reinstall RAMADDA.

</ol>

<subhead intoc="false" id="properties">RAMADDA Property Files</subhead>

For other  configuration options RAMADDA looks in its home directory for any .properties files.
While most of the RAMADDA configuration is accomplished through the web ADMIN interface there
are a number of configuration options that need to be placed in a properties file, e.g. 
<a href="database.html">database configuration</a>, 
<a href="#ssl">ssl options</a>, etc.
<p>
When loading properties files the first one that is loaded (if it exists) is &quot;repository.properties&quot;. 
RAMADDA will then load any
other .properties file in the home directory. It then loads any  properties files found in the 
<a href="plugins.html">plugins</a> directory.
<p>

To configure RAMADDA create a repository.properties file or
copy <a href="repository.dummy_properties">this one</a> and rename it repository.properties. 
The properties
defined in the local file override the ones defined in the system file.
<p>
In the source release the system properties file can be viewed:
<pre>
/org/ramadda/repository/resources/repository.properties
</pre>





<subhead intoc="false" id="directory">Directory Structure</subhead>

Under the home directory RAMADDA will create the following subdirectories:

<ul>

<a name="htdocs"></a>
<li> htdocs<br>
This is where RAMADDA will first look for any static web content that it is serving.  If it cannot find the file here
it looks in its internal system area. So, if you want to change the system style sheet, the logo.png file or any other web
content just place it here.
<p>
Note: Files here are relative to the top-level repository path. For example, if you have a URL:<pre>
    http://yourserver.edu/repository/somefile.gif
</pre>
Then RAMADDA will strip off the &quot;repository&quot; prefix and look for a file in the RAMADDA home dir:<pre>
    htdocs/somefile.gif
</pre>

If you had a URL:<pre>
    http://yourserver.edu/repository/somedir/somefile.gif
</pre>
Then RAMADDA looks in:<pre>
    htdocs/somedir/somefile.gif
</pre>





<li> logs<br>
Holds the log files.

<li> plugins<br>
RAMADDA has a plugin mechanism and it looks in this directory for the plugins.

<li> resources<br>
This is where RAMADDA will first look for any internal resources (e.g., html template files, etc.)


<li> storage<br>
This is where the uploaded  files are stored. The directory strucuture is:<pre>
y&lt;the year&gt;/m&lt;the month&gt;/d&lt;the day&gt;/the files
</pre>
There is also an upload  directory  that holds any anonymously uploaded files.

<li>entries<br>
This is where any attachments or any other file associated with an entry (except for the actual entry file) is held.

<li> tmp<br>
A temporary file space. RAMADDA manages the scouring ,etc., of old files.

<li> derby<br>
If you are running with the Derby database this directory holds the database

</ul>



<subhead intoc="false" id="configuration">Configuration</subhead>

RAMADDA for the most part can be configured through the <a href="admin.html">Admin pages</a>. When you are logged in to 
RAMADDA as an administrator there should be a &quot;Admin&quot; on the left side of the page.
<p>
<a name="tasks"></a>
Common tasks include:
<ul>
<li> Change the  repository title and logo in the <a href="admin.html#display">Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Display</a>
<li> Setting up an email server so RAMADDA can send email to users (e.g., for password notification). This is done on the
<a href="admin.html#contact">Admin-&gt;Settings-&gt;Site and Contact Information</a>  page.
<li> Adding <a href="adminusers.html">new users</a>.
<li> Creating new <a href="newentry.html">folders and uploading files</a>.
<li> Defining where RAMADDA <a href="admin.html#access">can serve files from</a>.
<li> Limiting <a href="access.html">access</a> to certain parts of the repository.
</ul>



<h3>Changing the Main Page</h3>

To change the presentation of the main entry page (the top-level RAMADDA page) you simply change the name and description
for the Entry. You do this with the <b>Edit-&gt;Edit Entry</b> menu.
<p>

You can use the <a href="wiki.html#wikidesc">wiki text facility (see &quot;Wiki Text in Other Entries&quot;)</a> for the description 
to customize the look and feel. 
For example, on Unidata's <a href="http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository">RAMADDA site</a> the name
of the top level Entry has been changed to &quot;RAMADDA&quot; and this description is used:<pre>

&lt;wiki&gt;
Welcome to Unidata's RAMADDA data repository. 
RAMADDA is a content management system with a focus on Earth Science data.

More information is available at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/">RAMADDA SourceForge site</a>.

<a name="ssl"></a>
<h3>Configuring SSL under Tomcat</h3>
If you have your Tomcat server configured for SSL access all you need to do is to tell RAMADDA what port it is running under. Add the property:
<pre>
ramadda.ssl.port=&lt;the ssl port&gt;
</pre>
to a properties file in the RAMADDA home directory (See <a href="#properties">above</a>).
<p>

<b>Note: When you define an SSL port then RAMADDA will automatically redirect all login and admin requests
to that port. If your Tomcat server is not really configured for SSL then you will not be able to access RAMADDA. 
See the <a href="faq.html#fixssl">FAQ</a> for how to fix this.</b>


<a name="ssljetty"></a>
<h3>Configuring SSL when running standalone</h3>
To configure secure SSL access to a stand-alone version of RAMADDA you need to
generate a keystore and an optional certificate. There are instructions 
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+configure+SSL">here</a>.
Ignore the step 4 as RAMADDA uses the below method to specify password, port, etc.
<p>
Once you have your keystore file generated you can copy it to the RAMADDA home directory as file &quot;keystore&quot;. You then need to specify some configuration options for RAMADDA through a .properties file that you place in the RAMADDA home directory. e.g., ssl.properties:

<pre>
ramadda.ssl.password=&lt;the password&gt;
ramadda.ssl.keypassword=&lt;the keystore password&gt;
ramadda.ssl.port=&lt;the ssl port&gt;

#You can override the location of the keystore. The default is:
#&lt;repository dir&gt;/keystore
#ramadda.ssl.keystore=alternative path to keystore

#If you want to skip ssl for now set this to true
#ramadda.ssl.ignore=true

</pre>

Alternatively you can specify these as command line arguments:
<pre>
-Dramadda.ssl.password=&lt;the password&gt; -Dramadda.ssl.keypassword=&lt;the keystore password&gt; -Dramadda.ssl.port=&lt;the ssl port&gt;
</pre>


<subhead intoc="false" id="fromsvn">Building RAMADDA from source</subhead>
It is easy to build and run RAMADDA from the SourceForge SVN tree. 
This assumes you have SVN, ANT and a Java compiler installed on your machine.
<p>
To build RAMADDA SourceForge SVN:
<ul>
<li> Check out RAMADDA from SourceForge:

<pre>
svn co https://ramadda.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ramadda
</pre>

<li> Build RAMADDA.  This creates a stand-alone version in dist/ramadda1.4a
<pre>
cd ramadda
ant
</pre>

<li> Run ramadda. This creates a ramadda home directory in: ~/.ramadda
<pre>
cd dist/ramadda1.4a
sh ramadda.sh
</pre>

<li>  Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/repository">http://localhost:8080/repository</a> to finish the RAMADDA install
<li>  Once configured shutdown the ramadda server (just kill the ramadda.sh run)
</ul>
