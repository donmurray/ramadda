[ht::head {Editing Entries and their Properties}]

<%nochildlist%>

Once an entry is created you can edit its name, description, time range
and lat/lon bounding box with the Edit Entry link in the Edit menu:<br>
[ht::cimg images/editmenu.gif {} {border=0}]
<p>

Which takes you to the Entry Edit form:

[ht::cimg images/editform.gif {Entry Edit Form} {border=0 width=600}]


<p>
If the description of an entry begins with &quot;<wiki>&quot;
then RAMADDA uses the description text as a wiki page
when displaying the entry in the default HTML view.
See <a href="wiki.html">here</a> for  more information
on wiki text in RAMADDA.




<subhead intoc="false" id="properties">Adding Properties</subhead>
In RAMADDA entries have some basic properties that can be edited in
the edit form, e.g., name, description, lat/lon bounding box, time range, etc.
One can also add any number of other properties elements to an entry.
<p>
Clicking on the &quot;Edit Menu -&gt; Add Properties&quot; link takes you to the
Add Properties form where you can select the type of properties to add.
e.g., Tag:

[ht::cimg images/addmetadata1.gif {Add Properties Form} {border=0 width=600}]


Select the type of properties to add, e.g.,  &quot;Tag&quot;:
[ht::cimg images/addmetadata2.gif {Add Tag Properties Form} {border=0 width=600}]



You can upload a file as an attachment to an entry:
[ht::cimg images/addthumbnail.gif {Add Thumbnail} {border=0 width=600}]

If you create a &quot;thumbnail&quot; attachment that is an image it will be displayed 
when  the entry is listed:
[ht::cimg images/thumbnails.gif {Thumbnail Images} {border=0 width=600}]

Clicking on a thumbnail image will display the full size image:
[ht::cimg images/thumbnailexpanded.gif {Expanded Thumbnail} {border=0 width=600}]



<subhead intoc="false" id="editproperties">Editing Properties</subhead>
Selecting the &quot;Edit -&gt; Edit Properties&quot; menu link allows you to edit and delete the properties
elements of an entry:

[ht::cimg images/editmetadata.gif {Edit Properties} {border=0 width=600}]

You can change any of the values of the properties and press &quot;Change&quot; or
you can select one or more properties elements and delete them.

<p>
Note: In RAMADDA when there is a collection of checkboxes in a form selecting one and then
selecting another with a Shift-Click toggles the range of checkboxes between the first the second
checkbox clicked. Doing a Control-Click on a checkbox toggles all of them on or off.
<p>
The &quot;Add selected to parent folder&quot; button allows you to select some properties and copy
them into the parent folder. For example, you may have a large number of data files one or more of which
have properties (see <a href="#autoproperties">Automatic Properties Harvesting</a> for more information).
Instead of laboriously adding properties to the parent folder you can just copy it from one of the 
children data entries.


<subhead intoc="false" id="autometadata">Automatic Properties Harvesting</subhead>
If there is a data file that RAMADDA can open using the NetCDF/CDM library (e.g., gridded data, point data,
radar, etc.) then there will be a &quot;CDL&quot; view link in the View menu for that entry. On that page
there will be a &quot;Add short properties&quot; and &quot;Add full properties&quot; links shown.
Adding  short properties will just try to determine the geospatial bounds and the time range of
the data file and set those properties. Adding full properties will also add as properties elements
the netcdf varbiables and all of the netcdf global attributes found.
