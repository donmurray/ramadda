[ht::head {Admin Settings}]

<%nochildlist%>

If you are a site administator an &quot;Admin&quot; link should be shown on the left
of every page. This takes you to a set of Site Administration pages.
<p>
The main admin settings page consists of:

<subhead  id="contact"  intoc="false">Site and Contact Information</subhead>

Specify the RAMADDA administator email for when RAMADDA sends email to users.
The Mail Server is the smtp mail server that RAMADDA can use to send email.
If this is not defined then user's cannot reset their passwords via email.
<p>
The Hostname and HTTP port should be set. RAMADDA uses these when it creates an absolute URL in some content  (e.g.,
a generated THREDDS catalog).
For information regarding SSL see the <a href="faq.html#ssl">FAQ</a>.
<p>
For information on the Server Registry settings  see <a href="remoteservers.html">remoteservers.html</a>.


<subhead  id="access"  intoc="false">Access</subhead>
Under Site Access you can specify that only registered users are allowe to access the site or only site Administrators.
<p>
The anonymous uploads Max Directory Size is the maximum size of the files that are uploaded through
the anonymous upload facility. This cap keeps rogue users from filling up the disk via anonymous uploads.
<p>
The Cache Size is the size of the cached files that RAMADDA generates (e.g., ftp files).
The cache is in: &lt;ramadda home&gt;/tmp/cache


<p>
If you are running the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/">Unidata LDM system</a> on the server machine you 
can allow RAMADDA services to inject files into the LDM queue by specifying the path to the pqinsert program and the queue location.

<subhead  id="filesystemaccess"  intoc="false">Accessing files on your server</subhead>
The File System Access field under the Access admin section is the list of server directories that can RAMADDA can serve files from.
For security any files that RAMADDA provides access to must be either in the locally managed storage area under the RAMADDA home directory or
they must be under the directory tree or trees specified in this field.
For example, when you have a harvester that does not move the files to RAMADDA storage then the directory you are harvesting needs to
be listed here. Likewise, any  <a href="configuration.html#localfiles">Local File View</a> entry needs to be listed here as well.




<subhead  id="display"  intoc="false">Display</subhead>
The Display settings allow you to change the title of the repostitory, add a footer, etc.
The Description is used when registering with external registry servers.
While you can always change the HTML templates used the Logo Image Location and URL are a quick
way to change what image is shown and the URL that is used when the logo is clicked.
<p>
The Translations field is a quick way to define new phrases to use in place of the default phrases that RAMADDA uses.
<p>
The Facebook Comments key allows you to integerate the Facebook comments facility. Contact RAMADDA support for more information.
<p>
If the Google Maps Key is defined then there is a Google Earth plugin display capability provided. You need to get an 
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html" target="other">API key</a>
for each domain name and port you might be running RAMADDA under.
The format of the admin setting is (one per line):
<pre>
hostname1,API key1,premier_opts1
hostname2,API key2,premier_opts2
</pre>

The premier_opts is optional.
 
e.g.:
<pre>
localhost,ABQIAAAA-JXA0-....
ramadda.org,ZXQIAAAA-JXA0-....
noaa.gov,,client=gme-<i>yourclientid</i>&sensor=false
</pre>
Notes: 
<ul>
<li>If you are doing development on a local machine you can get an API key for "localhost".
<li>If your organization is using the Google Maps API Premier, the key is left
blank and you supply the information through the "premier_opts" parameter.  
See the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/premier/guide.html" target="new">
Google Maps API Premier Developers Guide</a> for more information.  </ul> 


<subhead  id="output"  intoc="false">Available Output Types</subhead>
This section allows you to restrict the different entry outputs available.
For example, you can hide the  Data views, the Calendar view, etc.
