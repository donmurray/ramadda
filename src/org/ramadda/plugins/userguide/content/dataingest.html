There are lots of ways of getting information and data ingested into RAMADDA. 
It is often the case that you have a large collection of files organized in some fashion on your server that 
you would like to ingest into RAMADDA.

<h2>Accessing server side files</h2>

RAMADDA contains a white list of file system directories that it allows access to. 
When you have files on your server that you want to ingest into RAMADDA you need to 
specify the directories. 
<p>
Assuming you have a data directory on your server, e.g., <i>/mnt/data</i>:

<ul>

<li> Go to the site Administration pages from the &quot;Admin&quot; link:

[ht::cimg images/quick/adminlink.gif {} {border=0}]

<li> Open the  &quot;Access &quot; section and enter the data directory, e.g., /mnt/data, in the &quot;File system access&quot; field and press Change Settings:

[ht::cimg images/quick/access.gif {} {border=0}]

</ul>

<h2>Server Side File Entry</h2>

If you have a very large set of files or you have a set of files that are changing all of the time (e.g,, real-time feeds)
it might not be practical or possible to have RAMADDA ingest each and every file. However, you can provide RAMADDA access 
to these files by creating a Server Side File Entry. 


<ul>
<li> Go to the some destination folder  in RAMADDA

<li> Select &quot;New Entry&quot; under the File menu.

<li> Under the  &quot;General&quot; list choose Server Side Files.

<li>  This will take you to the Server Side File View Entry create form. 
Enter a name, the server file path and any patterns  to use to include or exclude specific files.

<li> Once created all of the  entries  shown under the new entry are dynamic and are not stored
in the RAMADDA database.
</ul>

<h2>Data and project organization</h2>

There are a number of contstructs provided by RAMADDA to help you create and organize your information and data.

You might have, for example, a directory tree like:
<pre>
Dataset_1
     datafile1.suff
     datafile2.suff
     ...
Dataset_2
     datafile1.suff
     datafile2.suff
...
</pre>



For the directories RAMADDA would create generic Folder entries. You can specify a different type (e.g., Dataset) in an entry xml file.


For a given file RAMADDA will look for the following entry xml file in its parent directory:
<pre>
.&lt;filename&gt;.ramadda.xml
.dir.ramadda.xml
.file.ramadda.xml
.ramadda.xml
</pre>

A directory can also contain its own entry xml file:

<pre>
.this.ramadda.xml 
</pre>



</body>
