<outputhandlers>
<!--
To specify a service that shows up as a link for an entry we define an outputhandler
with the ServiceOutputHandler  class. This xml can either contain the service xml directly
or it can refer to a service that was defined in a services.xml file
-->
  <outputhandler class="org.ramadda.repository.output.ServiceOutputHandler" category="Test Output">
    <service id="test_service1"  command="${test1.path}" label="Run example service 1" icon="/icons/pdf.png" >
<!-- ... There would be service attributes here. See services.xml ... -->
    </service>
  </outputhandler>

<!-- Or you can have the output handler reference the service id from a services.xml file -->
  <outputhandler class="org.ramadda.repository.output.ServiceOutputHandler" category="Test Output" serviceId="test_service2"/>



</outputhandlers>
