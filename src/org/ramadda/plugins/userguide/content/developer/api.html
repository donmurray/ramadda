The API into RAMADDA is declaratively defined with one or more
api.xml files:
[importxml developer/api_dummy.xml]

Note: The above file has "_dummy" appended to it. To actually use this in the IDV change the name so it ends with api.xml.

This file can be organized as a set of group tags that define
a <i>handler</i> and contain a set of <i>api</i>. The api tag
can also define a handler. The handlers are one of: 
usermanager, admin, harvestermanager, actionmanager, accessmanager, metadatamanager, repository.
<p>
External classes can be used as handlers by providing the full
class name. These handlers need to implement [class RequestHandler]
and need to have a public constructor that takes as argument the
Repository object and the xml api Element.
<p>
The api tag contains a <i>path</i> attribute which is used the 
the url path. e.g., the main way to view an entry is the &quot;/entry/show&quot; path. The url ends up looking like:<br> 
&lt;repository suffix&gt;/entry/show?id=&lt;entry id&gt;
</br>
The <i>method</i> attribute is the method name on the handler that is called.
These methods have the signature:
<pre>
public Result processEntryShow(Request request) throws Exception {
    ...
}</pre>

They take a [class Request] object and return a [class Result] object.
