<h2>Accessing your data</h2>

You can create and organize content in RAMADDA in a number of ways but we'll show you how to provide access 
to data that is already on your server.

<ul>

<li> Now, lets assume you have a data directory on your server, e.g., <i>/data/ldm</i>

<li> First, we need to tell RAMADDA that it is OK to provide access to that area of your file system. 
<ul>

<li> Go to the site Administration pages from the &quot;Admin&quot; link:

[ht::cimg images/quick/adminlink.gif {} {border=0}]

<li> Open the  &quot;Access &quot; section and enter the data directory, e.g., /data/ldm, in the &quot;File system access&quot; field and press Change Settings:

[ht::cimg images/quick/access.gif {} {border=0}]

</ul>

<li> Now you need to create an entry that provides access to that data.

<ul>
<li> Go to the top-level entry in RAMADDA (the &quot;Top&quot; link in the upper left).

<li> Select &quot;New Entry&quot; under the File menu.

<li> In the &quot;Or create a&quot; list choose Local File View and press Go:
[ht::cimg images/quick/createentry.gif {} {border=0}]


<li>  This will take you to the Local File View Entry create form. Enter a name, the file path and that
patterns  that match the files you want to exclude. When done press &quot;Add Local File View&quot;
[ht::cimg images/quick/localfileview.gif {} {border=0}]

Note: If you are providing access to your LDM/IDD data feed and you are also getting the NLDN lightning data and/or the ACARS feed make sure
you exclude those directories and files.


<li> Congratulations you are done! To access your server from Unidata's Integrated Data View (IDV) go to the top level entry, click on the 
View menu and copy the &quot;Catalog&quot; link into the IDV's catalog data chooser.


</ul>


</ul>





</body>
