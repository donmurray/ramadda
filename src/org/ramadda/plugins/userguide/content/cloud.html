An early version of a RAMADDA installer is available that does a complete installation of Postgres and RAMADDA.
This runs on the  Amazon Linux Image but could (should) run on other Unix-es and in other cloud environments.

<subhead intoc="false" id="installer">RAMADDA Installer</subhead>

The  installer <a href="examples/README.INSTALLER">README</a> describes 
the set of steps required to launch and configure an instance through the
<a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home">Amazon EC2 Dashboard</a>,
and how to download and run the RAMADDA installer on that instance.
<p>
An alternative  is to use the command line installation script described below.




<subhead intoc="false" id="amazon">Command Line Amazon Install</subhead>
The <a href="">aws.sh</a> script uses the 
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>
to create and configure an Amazon machine instance running RAMADDA. In just a couple of minutes you can have a server up and running.

Consult the fine Amazon <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html">CLI documentation</a>. 
You will need to set up an Amazon AWS account, create and download an access key file, and install the CLI runtime on your machine.
<p>
Once you have the CLI installed run the script:<pre>
  sh <a href="">aws.sh</a>
</pre>


You can kill the script at any time and re-run it without messing things up though you might see some warnings along the way.
<p>
The script looks like (with comments added):
<pre>
# Enter the access key you got from <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html#cli-signup">Amazon</a>
Do you want to enter your Amazon authentication (only needed one time)? [y|n]:
AWS Access Key ID: 
AWS Secret Access Key: 
Default region name [us-west-2]: 
Default output format [json]: 

# Enter machine info and disk size. 
# Note: the installer only works on Amazon Linux AMIs
Enter the image id [ami-55a7ea65]: 

# More info about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">instance types</a> 
Enter the instance type id [t1.micro]: 
Enter the volume size (GB) [100]: 

# This will create a &lt;key pair name&gt;.pem file, e.g. ramadda.pem This is the only way to access your instance
#If you've done this already you don't have to do it again
Enter the key pair name [ramadda]: 
Do you want to create the keypair [y|n]: 

# Create a security group called ramadda that has has ports 22, 80, 443 open
Create the security group ramadda? [y|n]: n

# If you have already created the instance and just want to finish up enter "n"
#We'll get the instance information from the instanceinfo.json file
Do you want to create the instance with image: ami-55a7ea65 type: t1.micro? [y|n]: n

# It takes some time to get the instance running so you might have to keep trying here
Instance id: i-de4ccfd2
Hit return to check to see if the instance is ready
Doesn't seem ready yet
....

# Once the instance is running the script will do a 'sudo yum update' and then will
# download and install the above RAMADDA installer and step through that installation process.
