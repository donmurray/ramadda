An early version of a RAMADDA installer is available that does a complete installation of Postgres and RAMADDA.
This runs on the  Amazon Linux Image but could (should) run on other Unix-es and in other cloud environments.

The  installer <a href="examples/README.INSTALLER">README</a> describes 
the set of steps required to launch and configure an instance through the
<a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home">Amazon EC2 Dashboard</a>,
and how to download and run the RAMADDA installer on that instance.
<p>
An alternative  is to use the command line installation script described below.

The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ramadda/code/HEAD/tree/src/org/ramadda/repository/release/installer/aws.sh">aws.sh</a> script uses the 
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>
to create and configure an Amazon machine instance running RAMADDA. In just a couple of minutes you can have a server up and running.

Consult the fine Amazon <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html">CLI documentation</a>. 
You will need to set up an Amazon AWS account, create and download an access key file, and install the CLI runtime on your machine.
<p>
Once you have the CLI installed run the script:<pre>
  sh <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ramadda/code/HEAD/tree/src/org/ramadda/repository/release/aws.sh">aws.sh</a>
</pre>


You can kill the script at any time and re-run it without messing things up though you might see some warnings along the way.
