You may need to update your plugins. Plugins are installed in the <i>&lt;ramadda home&gt;/plugins</i> directory. Most of the plugins are provided in an 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda<%ramadda.version%>/allplugins.jar/download">allplugins.jar</a> file. If you are installing RAMADDA for the first time you can opt to install the allplugins.jar during
the site installation process.
<p>

To update an existing RAMADDA install:
<ul>

<li> If you are running stand-alone then you will need to adjust your scripts to point to the ramadda<%ramadda.version%> directory.

<li> If you have installed the old allplugins.<i>zip</i> then delete the file and install allplugins.<i>jar</i>. 
Once you have installed allplugins.jar then RAMADDA will update it automatically in future releases.

<p>
<li> If you have the pointplugin.jar installed then delete it. It is now provided in the core.
<p>
<li> If you have other plugins installed then you should update them to the latest <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ramadda/files/ramadda<%ramadda.version%>/plugins/">versions</a>.
</ul>
