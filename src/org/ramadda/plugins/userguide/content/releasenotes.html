Note: This has changed in version 1.5. 
RAMADDA used to provide the plugins in an allplugins.zip file which contained individual plugins that would
be unzipped and written out every time RAMADDA ran. All of the plugin code and resources are now placed into one big jar file.
</div>

<b>If you have previously installed allplugins.zip then delete the file and install allplugins.jar.</b>

<b>If you have previously installed allplugins.jar then RAMADDA will automatically update the plugun at runtime.</b>

<b>If you have other plugins installed then you should update them to the latest versions</b>

If you are installing RAMADDA for the first time you can opt to install the allplugins.jar during
the site installation process.
