This uses the IDV generate.tcl script to create the workshop 
content and places it in htdocs/workshop directory. 

From the content directory do:

   tclsh <where your idv install is>/auxdata/docs/build/generate.tcl here 

(see content/make.sh)

Then from this directory just run ant. This builds the plugin and copies
it to your .ramadda/plugins directory.

To view the content in RAMADDA just go to:
http://localhost:8080/repository/workshop/index.html
