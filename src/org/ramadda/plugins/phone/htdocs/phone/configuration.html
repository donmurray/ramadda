The phone services in RAMADDA uses <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.


<h2>Configuring Twilio</h2>

You need to create an account at <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>. 
Once you have an account set up you should also have a new phone number. Twilio requires 2 URLs on your RAMADDA server
to be associated with the phone number:
<pre>
http://&lt;your ramadda&gt;/phone/twilio/sms
http://&lt;your ramadda&gt;/phone/twilio/voice
e.g.:
http://ramadda.org/repository/phone/twilio/sms
http://ramadda.org/repository/phone/twilio/voice
</pre>



You then need to define the following properties on your RAMADDA server
(e.g., in a phone.properties file in your RAMADDA home directory) 

<pre>
twilio.appid=
twilio.authtoken=
</pre>

This is the application SID and the authorization token you can get from your Twilio account dashboard.

<h2>Configuring Phone Harvesters</h2>
The real work in handling a call is done with one or more Phone Harvesters. These are RAMADDA harvesters that define
the RAMADDA folder to look at and access information. Go to Admin-Harvesters and create a new Phone Harvester.

<p>
The From Phone and To Phone are optional. If defined, this harvester will only access calls from/to these numbers.
<p>
If the Pass Code is specified than the body of the text message must contain this text.
<p>
To enable receiving voice messages specify a Voice Message.
