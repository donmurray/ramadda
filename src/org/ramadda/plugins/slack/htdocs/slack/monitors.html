You can add a monitor to your RAMADDA repository that will post a message to Slack when entries that match certain  search criteria are created.
<p>
Login to your RAMADDA and go to your User Settings-&gt;Monitors page.  Create a new Slack Monitor, specify its effective date range and any search
criteria (e.g.,text, spatial, type). Enter the  Incoming Web Hook URL you get from Slack. A link will be posted to slack when a new entry is created
that meets the search criteria.
