RAMADDA has a plugin facility that enables one to add new kinds of entry types, new content views, etc. In the RAMADDA home directory there is a &quot;plugins&quot; sub-directory. When RAMADDA starts up it loads all of the files in the plugins directory. 
<p>
There is a listing of available plugins at:

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ramaddacms/home/plugins">https://sites.google.com/site/ramaddacms/home/plugins</a>. 
To install a plugin just download the file and copy it to the RAMADDA home directory <i>plugins</i> directory.



<h3>How plugins work</h3>
RAMADDA determines what to do with a plugin file by looking at its file name. If the file is a .zip file RAMADDA will
unzip the files in the zip file and load each one as a plugin.
If the file is a jar file it will crack open the jar file and look at each contained file. It handles the files in the following way:
<ul>
<li> <i>.properties</i><br>
Any &quot;.properties&quot; files are loaded as  system properties.

<li> <i>.class</i><br> 
Any .class file is loaded via a classloader. Some classes are special:
<ul>
<li>
 If the class is an instanceof a org.ramadda.repository.auth.UserAuthenticator then the class is instantiated and it is used to handle user login and authentication.
<li> If the class is an instanceof org.ramadda.repository.AdminHandler then the class is instantiated. You can use this to add new apis into the repository and to add admin configuration options. Note: this is a work in progress.
</ul>

<li><i>api.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;api.xml&quot; then it defines new web application apis. 

<li><i>types.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;types.xml&quot; it defines new repository entry types.

<li><i>outputhandlers.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;outputhandlers.xml&quot; it defines new output handlers.

<li><i>metadata.xml</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;metadata.xml&quot; it defines new metadata types.

<li><i>.py</i><br>
If the file ends with &quot;.py&quot; then it defines new jython routines that are loaded into any jython interpreter (e.g., used by the repository script entry type).

<li><i>.sql</i><br> 
If the file ends with &quot;.sql&quot; then the file is evaluated at startup to define new database schemas.


<a name="languages"></a>
<li><i>.pack</i><br> 
RAMADDA supports multiple language translations.
<pre>
ramadda.language.default=
</pre>

<pre>
#This is an example language translation file. It is a .properties file. 
# "#" are comments.
#
#RAMADDA looks in the org/ramadda/repository/resources/languages package for
#any file that ends with ".pack". It then looks in the repository plugins directory
#for any .pack files. So, rename this file, (e.g., sp.pack) copy it to your plugins and put your 
#translations in it below. If you see a phrase in RAMADDA that is not getting translated
#just send a note about it to the developers. 
#
#The following 2 lines define the id of the language and its name
#If the id=default, e.g.:
#language.id=default
#Then this language pack will be used as the default translation for the site
#
language.id=example
language.name=Example Language 

#
#Here is where you do the translation
#.e.g:
#Phrase used in RAMADDA=Your translation




</ul>
