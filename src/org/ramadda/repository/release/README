RAMADDA  Stand-alone

To run RAMADDA stand-alone just do:
   sh ramadda.sh

This will run RAMADDA on port 8080.  To change the port edit ramadda.sh

This uses the default java runtime in your path. To change this edit ramadda.sh

When you first start up ramadda you can complete the initialization and configuration at:
http://localhost:8080/repository

Once logged in go to:
http://localhost:8080/repository/admin/settings
to do any further configurations

By default RAMADDA will use ~/.ramadda as its home directory. To change this use:
   sh ramadda.sh -Dramadda_home=/some/other/directory
