The latest version is 
repository.war: self contained war file for running under Tomcat, Glassfish, etc

ramadda1.6b.zip: stand-alone version of RAMADDA. Just needs Java to run. Download and unzip the file

allplugins.jar: You only need this if you have previously installed RAMADDA without 
installing allplugins.jar
If you already have the allplugins.jar installed in your release then RAMADDA will automatically update it

plugins: various plugins that are not contained in allplugins.jar

Note: if you have previously installed the pointplugin.jar this has now been rolled into the
allplugins.jar. You should delete the pointplugin.jar from your RAMADDA install directory
before installing the new RAMADDA version
