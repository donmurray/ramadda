RAMADDA  Stand-alone

To run RAMADDA stand-alone just do:
   sh ramadda.sh

This will run RAMADDA on port 8080.  To change the port edit ramadda.sh

When you first start up ramadda you can complete the initialization and configuration at:
http://localhost:8080/repository

Once logged in go to:
http://localhost:8080/repository/admin/settings
to do any further configurations

By default RAMADDA will use ~/.ramadda as its home directory. To change this use:
   sh ramadda.sh -Dramadda_home=/some/other/directory
