RAMADDA Version 1.1

See the installation docs at:
http://motherlode.ucar.edu/repository/help/installing.html

Look at the ramadda.sh to see how to run RAMADDA stand-alone
When you first start up ramadda you can complete the initialization and configuration at:
http://localhost:8080/repository


Once logged in go to:
http://localhost:8080/repository/admin/settings
to do any further configurations


################# Information for the source distribution  #################
If you have installed the source distribution (i.e., the repository_src.zip, not from SVN)
To build and run ramadda just do:
ant compile 

This compiles the local ramadda source and runs the server on port 8080


################# Running from SVN ################################
To build RAMADDA just do:
ant compile

The required classpath is:
${lib_dir}/repositorylib.jar:${lib_dir}/servlet-api.jar
where lib_dir is ramadda/lib

If you have the ramadda/src directory in your classpath and the requisite jar files you can run RAMADDA stand-alone with:
java -Xmx1024m -server   org.ramadda.repository.server.JettyServer



################# Making repositorytds.jar ################################

repositorytds.jar holds the classes that we use from the thredds.war.  We unjar the war and 
then unjar the jar files contained in it. There are some jars that we skip. To create this
jar file get the latest thredds.war (from ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds) and copy it
to the ramadda/lib directory.  Then from the lib directory execute the tcl script:
cd ramadda/lib
tclsh ../org/ramadda/repository/release/makethredds.tcl


################# Making a release ################################

You first need to build the help documentation. See below.

To make the full release do:
ant release

This creates the following files in trunk/lib. The *'ed files are those that get released

repository.jar
repositorylib.jar
*repository.war  - The war to be used by Tomcat
*ramadda1.3b.zip  - The zip file that holds the stand-alone RAMADDA release (which uses Jetty)
*repositoryclient.jar  - Used by 3rd party clients (e.g., IDV, JGRASS) 
*repositoryclient.zip  - To run the stand-alone command line client



################# Building the help  ################################

The integrated user documentation is in:
docs/userguide/content

This requires tclsh in your path and  uses the tcl generate.tcl script. 

To build the docs do:
cd docs/userguide/content
source make.sh

This generates the documentation and places it in:
docs/userguide/processed

When the RAMADDA release is built the processed html docs are included in the result.
