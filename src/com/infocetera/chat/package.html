<h3>DisplayCanvas, EditCanvas, WhiteBoardCanvas, AvatarCanvas</h3>
Graphics are displayed using  a set of canvas classes and a set of Glyph
classes.
<p>
The canvas  class hierarchy looks like:
<pre>
   java.awt.Canvas
     |
   com.infocetera.common.ScrollCanvas (manages scrolling and scaling)
     |
   com.infocetera.chat.DisplayCanvas (holds and draws a set of glyph objects)
     |
   EditCanvas (cut/copy/paste, move, resize)
     |
     +-------------------+
     |                   |
     |                 AvatarCanvas (manages a set of graphical avatars
     |                                representing users in a chat session)
     |
   WhiteBoardCanvas (part of the chat/whiteboard -manages a set of basic glyph
                      types (e.g., rectangle, polygon, line, text, image) and
		      manages communication with the whiteboard server.)

    Glyph  (A mark on the screen, holds display state)		      
     |
     |
     +----------------------+-----------------+
     |                      |                 |
     |                   LineGlyph           PolyGlyph 
     |                       (straight line)      (polygon)
  RectangleGlyph 
     | (draws rectangles, ovals, round-rects)
     |
     +-------------------+------------------+
     |                   |                  |
     |                   |                  |
   ImageGlyph         TextGlyph          UserGlyph 
                                             (Used in the avatar canvas)


  com.infocetera.util.SocketApplet					     
        |   (Communicates to a server either via a socket or through
	|     http based  polling.)
        |
   ChatApplet
           (Creates the user interface and handles the text chat
	    functions. Routes messages to the ChatCanvas)

</pre>


The base class, DisplayCanvas,  manages a set of Glyph-s. A Glyph
represents some mark on the canvas (e.g., rectangle, image, text).
The DisplayCanvas knows how to paint the Glyph-s, search for Glyph-s,
highlight the nearest one and maintain a selection set of Glyph-s.
<p>
The EditCanvas supports  a basic Command pattern
for manipulating the set of Glyphs drawn in the DisplayCanvas class.
The EditCanvas knows how to do cut/copy/paste and how to move
and resize Glyph-s.
It contains a CanvasCommand object that, when non-null, it routes
events  (e.g., mouse clicks, key strokes, etc.) to.
<p>
The AvatarCanvas shows a set of UserGlpyhs.
<p>
The WhiteBoardCanvas routes canvas commands through the ChatApplet
and parses incoming commands.




<h3> Client/Server protocol</h3>
<b> Note: The description of the protocol is not up to date </b>

The chat applet uses a simple message based protocol based on xml.
<p>
The form of a message is:<pre>
&lt;message type="message type" (attributes)*&gt;body&lt;/message&gt;
</pre>

When first starting up the chat applet sends a SESSION message:<pre>
&lt;message type="SESSION"
         channel="the channel specified in the applet param tag"
         userid="the user id"
	 sessionid="the sessionid specified in the applet param tag"&gt;&lt;/message&gt;
</pre>

The channel can be considered the "room" id of this applet.

The server responds to the new applet with the STATE, USERLIST (list of
current users including the current user). There can also be a
ROOMS message that lists the available rooms. The STATE message contains
the userid of this user,  and (optionally) an EDIT message to tell the applet if
the user has edit privileges (though, this is somewhat an Infocetera
specific thing):

<pre>
&lt;message type="STATE" userid="jeffm" edit="true" /&gt;
&lt;message type="USERLIST"&gt;
	&lt;user name="wilma"/&gt;
	&lt;user name="barney"/&gt;	
	&lt;user name="fred"/&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;message type="ROOMS"&gt;
	&lt;room name="Room name" id="room id"/&gt;
	&lt;room name="..." id="..."/&gt;	
&lt;/message&gt;
</pre>

The STATE message allow the server to set certain aspects of the client:
<pre>&lt;message type="STATE" (state attributes) /&gt;</pre>
Where state attributes are:<pre>
userid="some user id"       //The id of the current user
interval="newpollinterval"  //Change the polling interval (in milliseconds)
</pre>

Once a new user sends a SESSION message the 
server then sends a USERADD message to all other users:<pre>
&lt;message type="USERADD"&gt;&lt;username="fred"/&gt;&lt;/message&gt;
</pre>

The browser can tell the servere that they are leaving the current
room with the LEAVEROOM message:
<pre>&lt;message  type="LEAVEROOM"/&gt;</pre>



When the browser goes to some other page or is shutdown  
the applet sends the CLOSE message to the server: 
<pre>&lt;message  type="CLOSE"/&gt;</pre>

The server then sends the USERREMOVE message to all other applets:
<pre>&lt;message type="USERREMOVE"&gt;&lt;user name="fred"/&gt;&lt;/message&gt;</pre>


During the chat session a text message is sent as:
<pre>&lt;message  type="TEXT" &gt;Hello there&lt;/message&gt;</pre>

A graphics message is sent as:
<pre>&lt;message  type="GFX" &gt;Some graphics specification&lt;/message&gt;</pre>

When receiving the above incoming content messages the server should
send them to each of the other chat clients (don't send them to the
original sender). The original sender should be included in a "from"
attribute:
<pre>&lt;message  from="jeffm" type="GFX" &gt;Some graphics specification&lt;/message&gt;</pre>

Optionally an id attribute can be included:
<pre>&lt;message  from="jeff" id="some  id" type="TEXT" &gt;
Hellothere
&lt;/message&gt;
</pre>

The chat applet will keep track of the last message id it receives.
It uses this last message id when sending in the poll request. This would
allow, for example, the server to store each message on a channel,
bumping up some id counter. When a client makes a request sending to
the server the last mesage it has seen the server can simply run
through its list of sent messages and send the ones the client
has not seen.
